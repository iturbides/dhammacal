**DhammaCal** is a lightweight app designed to display two parallel Theravāda calendar views:

1. **A UTC-based lunar-solar calendar** – which shows full moon and new moon days using the Universal Time Coordinate (UTC) as reference.
2. **The Mahānikāya Uposatha Calendar** – based on the traditional Thai Forest Sangha's reckoning, showing Uposatha moon days (observance days) according to the Mahānikāya method.

---

The purpose of this app is to offer a quick and intuitive overview of both the **astronomically-based moon phases** and the **traditional Uposatha observance dates** as preserved in the Thai Forest Tradition.
